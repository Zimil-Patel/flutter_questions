  }
  ```

**Q13: How do you use a `while` loop in Dart?**
- **A13:** A `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true:
  ```dart
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 5) {
    print(i);

**Q9: How do you handle user interaction in Flutter?**
- **A9:** User interaction is handled using widgets like `GestureDetector` for taps and swipes, and by defining callback functions for buttons and other interactive widgets.

**Q10: Explain the concept of `State` and `setState` in Flutter.**
- **A10:**
  - **State:** Represents the mutable state of a widget.
  - **`setState`:** A method that informs Flutter that the state has changed and triggers a rebuild of the widget’s subtree.
