# Q.1 What is Flutter?Write the Advantages and Disadvantages of Flutter

- Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. 
- This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

- Flutter UI software development kit used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using Flutter:

### Advantages:

1. **Single Codebase**: Flutter allows developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop, saving time and effort in development.

2. **Fast Development**: Hot Reload feature in Flutter enables developers to see the changes made in the code almost instantly, speeding up the development process and enhancing productivity.

3. **Rich UI**: Flutter provides a rich set of customizable widgets that enable developers to create visually appealing and highly interactive user interfaces.

4. **Performance**: Flutter apps are compiled directly to native machine code, resulting in high performance and smooth animations without needing a bridge to communicate with the native components.

5. **Access to Native Features**: Flutter allows developers to access native features and SDKs through platform channels, enabling integration with device-specific functionalities seamlessly.

6. **Community Support**: Flutter has a large and active community of developers who contribute packages, libraries, and resources, providing extensive support and resources for developers.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Large App Size**: Flutter apps tend to have larger file sizes compared to their native counterparts because they include Flutter framework and engine, which can affect download and installation times.

2. **Limited Libraries**: While Flutter has a growing ecosystem of packages and libraries, it may still lack certain libraries or have fewer options compared to more established frameworks like React Native or native development.

3. **Learning Curve**: Developers familiar with traditional mobile development may face a learning curve when adopting Flutter due to its different architecture and paradigm.

4. **Platform Differences**: Although Flutter aims for platform consistency, there may still be differences in UI and behavior across different platforms, requiring platform-specific adjustments and testing.

5. **Integration with Native Code**: While Flutter provides mechanisms for integrating with native code, complex integrations may require additional effort and expertise, especially when dealing with platform-specific APIs and functionalities.
